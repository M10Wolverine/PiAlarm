# PiAlarm
##Currently on hiatus until summer## 

Code for a morning alarm system to replace a typical audio alarm clock. 
The Pi gradually turns on the lights leading up to the wake up time to try to simulate sunrise.
At the specified time it also uses a vibrational motor to nudge the user awake. 

Current on a proof of concept prototyping stage. Preliminary circuit design is being tested with simple LEDs

To do: dimming, attaching to a more powerful lighting system using a relay or some other method
